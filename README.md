# Angular demo app
This is a dummy app for trying out different Angular concepts. 

This repo may collect some good-to-know features, use-cases and best practices over time, however it will never contain anything very *usable*.


## Installation

First, clone this repo

```
```

Install NPM dependencies
```
npm install
```

Build using Gulp
```
gulp
```

Run the server
```
node server | bunyan
```


It also needs bunyan installed globally
```
npm install bunyan -g
```

Gulp can also be used for compiling files on the fly
```
gulp watch
```

And also for live reloading using browsersync
```
gulp browser-sync
```
